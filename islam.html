        <h1>Islamic Faith</h1>
        <p><figure><img src="img/islam.jpg" alt="islam"><figcaption>Islamic Symbol for the<br> Holy Moth of Ramadhan</figcaption></figure>Islam is a faith and comprehensive way of life that literally means
            'peace through<br> submission to God.'' It provides a clear understanding of a person's relationship<br> with God, purpose in life, and ultimate destiny. A Muslim is someone who adopts<br> the Islamic way of life by believing in the Oneness of God and the prophethood<br> of Muhammad, peace be upon him (pbuh). Today, Islam is one of the fastest<br> growing religions and is practiced by more than 1.2 billion Muslims across the world.<br>The most essential principle in Islam is the purely monotheistic belief in one God.<br> God is the Creator of everything in the universe and is unique from His creation.<br> Muslims are encouraged to develop a direct and personal relationship with God<br> without any intermediaries. Muslims often refer to God as Allah, which simply<br> means “God” in the Arabic language. Islamically, God(Allah) has 99 names and<br> among those names, Allah is one of them and the first of all names. Allah describes<br> Himself in the holy book of muslims known as <srong>Quran</srong>, by stating:
        <pre>
            "Say: He is Allah, the one and only.
             Allah, the eternal,absolute;
             He begettethnot, nor is he begotten,
             And there is none like unto him."
             (chapter 112 verse 1-4)
        </pre> </p>
        <p>Islam is the culmination of the universal message of God taught by all of His<br> prophets. Muslims believe that a prophet was chosen for every nation  in their<br> history, enjoining them to worship God alone and delivering guidance on how<br> to live peacefully with others. There were 25 prophets that Allah sent to guide<br> people and these include;
            <ul>                                               
                <li>Prophet Adam</li>
                <li>Prophet Idris</li>
                <li>Prophet Noah</li>
                <li>Prophet Hud</li>
                <li>Prophet Swaleh</li>
                <li>Prophet Lut</li>
                <li>Prophet Abrahim/Abraham</li> 
                <li>Prophet Ismael</li> 
                <li>Prophet Ishaaq</li>
                <li>Prophet Ya'aqub/Jacob</li> 
                <li>Prophet Yusuf/Joseph</li>
                <li>Prophet Shu'aib</li>
                <li>Prophet Ayyub</li>
                <li>Prophet Dhulkiful</li> 
                <li>Prophet Musa/Moses</li>
                <li>Prophet Harun</li>
                <li>Prophet Dawud/David</li>
                <li>Prophet Sulayman</li> 
                <li>Prophet Elyas</li>
                <li>Prophet Elyasa</li>
                <li>Prophet Yunus</li>
                <li>Prophet Zakariyya</li>
                <li>Prophet Yahya</li>
                <li>Prophet isa/Jesus</li>  
                <li>Prophet Muhammad</ul>
             peace be upon them all. The prophets all conveyed the consistent divine message of<br> worshiping one God, along with specific societal laws for each nation's circumstances.<br>However, after the prophets delivered the divine guidance to their people, their  message<br> was lost, abandoned, or changed over time, with only parts of the original message intact.<br> God then sent another prophet to rectify their beliefs.<strong>In order to restore the original call<br> of all prophets, Allah sent Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) as the final<br> prophet to all of humanity in the 7th century C.E.</strong></p>
             <p>In 610 C.E., Angel Gabriel visited Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) with<br> the first divine message. For the next 23 years, he continued to receive revelations<br> until the message was completed. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) called<br> people towards the belief in one God and encouraged them to be just and merciful<br> to one another. He was a messanger of Allah  sent to guide all the entire humankind.
                <pre>
                    So we have taught thee the inspired message,
                    "Follow the ways of Abrahamthe True in Faith,
                     and he joined not gods with Allah."
                     (Quran chapter 16 verse 123)
                </pre>
             </p>
             <p>Muslims also believe that Allah sent revealed books as guidance to humanity through<br> His prophets. These include:
                <ul>
                  <li>The Zabur given to prophet Dawud</li>
                  <li>The Taurat(Torah) given to prophet Musa</li>
                  <li>The Injeel given to prophet Isa </li>
                  <li>The Quran recieved by prophet Muhammad</li>
                </ul>    
                The Quran is the last revelation from Allah, consisting of His literal speech. It confirms truths<br> from the previous scriptures and maintains the same core message of worshiping Allah and<br> living righteously. allah has ensured that the Quran is protected from corruption, safeguarding<br> it for all of humanity to benefit from until the end of time. It is the only holy book that has<br> been meticulously preserved in its original text.</p>
              <h2>The Five Pillars of Islam</h2>  
              <p>Islam clearly adresses the real puporse of life. Allah declares in Quran, chapter 51 verse 56
                <pre>
                    "I have  created jinns and 
                    mankind,only to worship me "
                </pre>
                Worship in Islam is a comprehensive concept that urges people to be conscious of Allah throughout<br> their daily lives and provides a framework to help people live a balanced and virtuous life. Hence<br> the purpose of life islamically is  worship <strong>Only and Only Allah</strong> the Creator of everything, without<br> associating Him with any other gods.  </p>
                <p>This way of life promotes strong moral character, good relations with people, and just<br> and harmonious societies. Devoting one's self to a life of submission to God is the key<br> to attaining a true sense of peace because it produces a balance of spiritual needs with<br> worldly affairs. It also lends special meaning to the concept of living one's life responsibly,<br> aware of the accountability to come in the hereafter. Islam has five pillars that all muslims<br> must  follow as long as they're alive. and these pillars include:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Shahada(Profession of Faith).</strong> Believing that there is non to worship but Allah and Prophet<br> Muhammad is His messanger. in this pillar, muslims have to believe in the Oneness of Allah<br> withought associating Him with any other gods and accepting thet prophet Muhammad is not<br> more than His messanger.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Five Daily Prayers.</strong>These are the obligatory(compulsory) congregation prayers that are<br> prformed daily. Muslims must pray at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, after sunset and after dark.<br> They must be performed in the mosqueOnly women are excused to perform these prayers<br> inside their houses. </li>
                        <li><strong>Zakat(Alms).</strong> In accordance with Islamic law, Muslims donate a fixed portion of their income<br> to community members in need. Many rulers and wealthy Muslims build mosques, drinking<br> fountains, hospitals, schools, and other institutions both as a religious duty and to secure the<br> blessings associated with charity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fasting the Holy Month of Ramadhan</strong>Ramadhan is the 9th month on the islamic calender.<br> Fasting is compulsary during this month to all healthy adult muslims, apart from the sick<br>  people that are out of their senses(mentally disturbed), and the old. This is a month of<br> repentance and doing good, forexample, helping the needy, being kind and so on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hajj(Pilgrimage).</strong>Hajj means visiting the holy mosque(kaaba) in mecca.Every healthy and<br> financially  stable muslim is supposed to visit the kaaba. </li>
                    </ol>

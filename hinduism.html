    <h1>Hinduism Faith</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hinduism is one of the world's oldest religions and is the oldest religion that is practiced today. The<br> religious tradition of the <strong>Hiduism</strong>is primarily focused on connecting to the supreme god or ultimate<br> reality, known as Brahman, and bettering oneself to escape the cycle of reincarnation. The tradition<br> functions not only as religion, but the definition of Hinduism also includes combining beliefs,cultural<br> practices, and philosophy of acient and mordern India. Hinduism is famous for having thousands of<br> deities,both gods and godesses, but most hinduism believe that all of the duties are  manifestations<br> of Brahman. In the 21st century, Hinduism is considered the third most-practiced religion in the<br> whole world. it is especially comman in India,the area where it originated, as 94%  of the world's<br> hindu population resides there. It is also widely practiced in Nepal and Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The term Hinduism is derived from the word <strong>Hindu</strong>which is a Persian distortion of <strong>Sindhu</strong>, the acient name for<br> the <strong>River Indus</strong>running through Northern India. To thet end, it is less a religion than a cordification  of the<br> evolving way of life and beliefs of the inhabitant of the region. A conglomerate of diverse beliefs and traditions,<br> Hinduism has no single founder.The advent of the Aryans into North India assimilated certain beliefs of the late<br> Neolithic and early Harappan period(5500-2600BC) to their own religions.</p>

    <h3>Scriptures and Beliefs</h3>
    <p>Hinduism is not always practiced as a scriptural tradition, with people relying on texts for guidance. However, there<br> are a variety of texts that are authoritative for the tradition. The tradition breaks religious texts into two categories:<br> the shruti, meaning what is heard, and the smriti, meaning what is remembered. The latter category contains popular<br> religious literature, including the epics the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The former category contains many sacred<br> scriptures that monks and other religious leaders have preserved and studied over time, all of which are contained in the<br> Vedas.</p>
    <p><strong>Shruti-</strong>The authoritative texts of Hinduism are called shastras, or scriptures, and contain a collection of the spiritual laws<br> passed along by Hindu saints and sages. In the shastras, the Vedas, which simply means knowledge, are the oldest texts of<br> Hinduism. According to the tradition, the Vedas does not contain ideas just thought of by humans but instead, contains<br> knowledge that always existed in the world but was finally written down. Some believe that they began as oral traditions<br> that the gods gave to scholars to write down. The texts are primarily focused on rituals and how to worship different deities.<br>The Vedas also contain other collections of Hindu scripture. The Brahmanas are a subset of the Vedas that provide Hindu<br> commentary on the earlier Vedas. Perhaps the best-known section of the Vedas is the Upanishads. The Upanishads are the<br> latest written texts in the Vedas and contain the philosophical discourse of the tradition. The name Upanishads literally means<br> to sit down near, which is appropriate as the texts are formatted as Hindu teachers or gurus passing down knowledge to their<br> students.</p>
    <p><strong>Smriti-</strong>This contains the texts that most non-monastic Hindus read and study. Instead of lofty philosophical thought, details<br> on ancient Hindu rituals, and instructions of how to worship the deities, the smriti contains two epics and other mythologies<br> that tell two of the most important stories in Hinduism. The Puranas, which means old or ancient, contain mythologies and<br> creation stories of the deities. The Ramayana is one of the Hindu epics that tell the story of Prince Rama, an incarnation of<br> the god Vishnu, killing the demon king Ravana to rescue his wife, Sita, whom Ravana had kidnapped. The story is significant<br> because Rama follows his dharma, or duty, throughout the story, which becomes an example for all Hindus.The Mahabharata<br> is the second Hindu epic and is also the longest recorded poem in the world. This epic describes a war that takes place between<br> families in India (Mahabharata literally means great India) who are part of a larger royal family: the Pandavas and the Kauravas.<br> The two families are at war for who will take the throne of India, but the Pandavan warrior-prince Arjuna is conflicted because<br> hinduism teaches non-violence. One of the most famous and influential parts of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, meaning<br> song of the Lord, which contains Arjuna seeking help over what his role is in the war from Krishna, the incarnation of Vishnu.<br> Despite the emphasis on non-violence, Krishna explains that Arjuna's dharma, or duty, as a warrior and prince is the most<br> important path for him to follow.Scene from the Bhagavad Gita  where Krishna speaks to Arjuna.Scene from the Bhagavad Gita<br> where Krishna speaks to Arjuna</p>

        <p>Confucianism is a philosophy and belief system from ancient China, which laid the foundation<br> for much of Chinese culture. Confucius was a philosopher and teacher who lived from 551 to<br> 479 B.C.E. His thoughts on ethics, good behavior, and moral character were written down by<br> his disciples in several books, the most important being the Lunyu. Confucianism believe in<br> ancestor worship and human-centered virtues for living a peaceful life. The golden rule of<br> Confucianism is "Do not do unto others what you would not want others to do unto you."</p>
        <p>There is debate over if Confucianism is a religion. Confucianism is best understood as an ethical<br> guide to life and living with strong character. Yet, Confucianism also began as a revival of an<br> earlier religious tradition. There are no Confucian gods, and Confucius himself is worshipped as a<br> spirit rather than a god. However, there are temples of Confucianism, which are places where<br> important community and civic rituals happen. This debate remains unresolved and many people<br> refer to Confucianism as both a religion and a philosophy.</p>
        <p>The main idea of Confucianism is the importance of having a good moral character, which can<br> then affect the world around that person through the idea of "cosmic harmony". If the emperor<br> has moral perfection, his rule will be peaceful and benevolent. Natural disasters and conflict  are<br> the result of straying from the ancient teachings. This moral character is achieved through the<br> virtue of ren, or "humanity", which leads to more virtuous behaviours, such as respect, altruism,<br> and humility. Confucius believed in the importance of education in order to create this virtuous<br> character. He thought that people are essentially good yet may have strayed from the appropriate<br> forms of conduct. Rituals in Confucianism were designed to bring about this respectful attitude<br> and create a sense of community within a group.</p>
        <p>The idea of "filial piety", or devotion to family, is key to Confucius thought. This devotion can<br> take the form of ancestor worship, submission to parental authority, or the use of family metaphors,<br> such as “son of heaven,” to describe the emperor and his government. The family was the most<br> important group for Confucian ethics, and devotion to family could only strengthen the society<br> surrounding it.<br>While Confucius gave his name to Confucianism, he was not the first person to discuss many of<br> the important concepts in Confucianism. Rather, he can be understood as someone concerned<br> with the preservation of traditional Chinese knowledge from earlier thinkers. After Confucius'<br> death, several of his disciples compiled his wisdom and carried on his work. The most famous<br> of these disciples were Mencius and Xunzi, both of whom developed Confucian thought further.</p>
        <p>Confucianism remains one of the most influential philosophies in China. During the Han Dynasty,<br> emperor Wu Di (reigned 141-87 B.C.E.) made Confucianism the official state ideology. During this<br> time, Confucius schools were established to teach Confucian ethics. Confucianism existed alongside <br>Buddhism and Taoism for several centuries as one of the most important Chinese religions. In the Song<br> Dynasty (960-1279 C.E.) the influence from Buddhism and Taoism brought about “Neo-Confucianism,”<br> which combined ideas from all three religions. However, in the Qing dynasty (1644-1912 C.E.), many<br> scholars looked for a return to the older ideas of Confucianism, prompting a Confucian revival</p>

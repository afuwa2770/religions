        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><figure><img src="img/pagan.jpg" alt="pagan" width="150" height="150"><figcaption>Paganism Symbol Image</figcaption></figure><strong>What is Paganism</strong><br>This means holding religious beliefs other than those of the main world religions; or a<br> religion other than the main world religions, specifically a non-religion or pre-Christian<br> religion.</p>
        <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term “Pagan” comes from the Late Latin word paganus,<br> which was used at the end of the Roman Empire to identify those who practiced a religion<br> other than Christianity, Judaism, or Islam. Early Christians often used the term to refer to<br> non-Christians who worshiped multiple deities. In Latin, paganus originally meant “country<br> dweller” or “civilian;” it is believed that the word's religious meaning developed either from<br> enduring non-Christian religious practices of those who lived far from the Roman cities where<br> Christianity was more quickly adopted, or from the fact that early Christians referred to<br> themselves as “soldiers of Christ,” making nonbelievers “civilians.” </p>
        <h3>Pagan History and Beliefs</h3>
        <p>According to patheos.com, Paganism represents a wide variety of traditions that emphasize<br> reverence for nature and a revival of ancient polytheistic and animistic religious practices.<br> Some modern forms of Paganism have their roots in 19th century C.E. European nationalism<br> (including the British Order of Druids), but most contemporary Pagan groups trace their immediate<br> organizational roots to the 1960s and have an emphasis on archetypal psychology and a spiritual<br> interest in nature.</p>
        <p>Paganism is simultaneously a prehistoric and postmodern religion-it is as ancient as the fertility<br> symbols associated with the veneration of gods and goddesses tens of thousands of years ago,<br> while its newest forms have emerged as recently as the mid-20th century. Broadly speaking,<br> Paganism encompasses two key characteristics: <br>1) religious and spiritual practices concerning the worship of, or devotion to, the earth, the<br> natural world, and/or the manifest physical universe<br> 2) belief in spiritual beings: goddesses, gods, nature spirits (fairies, elves, power animals),<br> and ancestral spirits.</p>
        <p><strong>Polytheism:</strong><br> One principle of the Pagan movement is polytheism, the belief in and veneration of multiple<br> gods or goddesses. Within the Pagan movement, there can be found many deities, both male<br> and female, who have various associations and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture,<br> and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form and are<br> viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen as perfect, but rather are venerated<br> as being wise and powerful. Pagans feel that this understanding of the gods reflected the<br> dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humor.</p>
        <p><strong>Animism:</strong><br>Animism means all things, whether animate or inanimate, contain a spirit or soul. Animism<br> believes in the existence of good and bad souls, and ancient religions often used spells and<br> incantations to ward off evil spirits and invite the company of good ones.To receive the good<br> favor of the benevolent spirits and to escape the grasp of harmful ones, humans must, according<br> to animism, worship such beings and offer sacrifices and rituals to appease such spirits. Like the<br> Ancient Greek religions, it was appease or face the consequences. No love, grace, or forgiveness<br> existed in such things.</p>
        <p>Animism is linked with the existence of idolatry. The idea that a spirit can invade an image of<br> gold, stone, or wood is woven in the fabric of just about every ancient civilization (Daniel 5:4).<br> We see this in the case of many of Israel's enemies. The Canaanites worshipped Baal (Psalm<br> 106:28). The Assyrians praised Dagon (Judges 16:23), the list of enemies and their practices of<br> animism goes on throughout all 66 books.<br>Animistic practices included child sacrifice, animal sacrifice, charms, enchantments, among<br> other rituals which dot the Old and New Testament narrative.</p>
        <p>A key part of most Pagan worldviews is the holistic concept of a universe that is interconnected.<br> This is connected with a belief in either pantheism or panentheism. In both beliefs, divinity and<br> the material or spiritual universe are one. For pagans, pantheism means that "divinity is inseparable<br> from nature and that deity is immanent in nature".</p>
        <p>Pagan ritual can take place in both a public and private setting. Contemporary Pagan ritual is<br> typically geared towards "facilitating altered states of awareness or shifting mindsets." In order<br> to induce such altered states of consciousness, pagans utilize such elements as drumming,<br> visualization, chanting, singing, dancing, and meditation. American folklorist Sabina Magliocco<br> came to the conclusion, based upon her ethnographic fieldwork in California that certain Pagan<br> beliefs "arise from what they experience during religious ecstasy."<br>Paganism's public rituals are generally calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that Pagans,<br> use as a basis varied across Europe. Nevertheless, common to almost all Pagan religions is an<br> emphasis on an agricultural cycle and respect for the dead. Common Pagan festivals include those<br> marking the summer solstice and winter solstice as well as the start of spring and the harvest.</p>

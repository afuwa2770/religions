        <h1>Sikhism Faith</h1>
        <h2>sikhism Basics</h2>
        <p>Sikhism is the world's fifth largest relgion with more than twenty five million sikhs worldwide.<br> The sikhs spiritual guides and teachers(Gurus), established. Guru Nnak was the fist Guru and<br> was born in the fifteenth century in the punjab region of India.Sikhs believe in the oneness of<br> all beings and the equality of evryone. </p>
        <p>The Sikh faith is a monotheistic religion, meaning Sikhs worship one God. Guru Nanak taught<br> that one must honor God by honoring others and the Earth, God’s creation. Nine more Gurus<br> succeeded Guru Nanak, and continued to spread his teachings across the world. Guru Gobind<br> Singh was the last Guru; he named the Sikh sacred text, the Guru Granth Sahib, to be the<br> eternal Guru that would guide the Sikhs going forward.</p>
        <p>The verses of the Guru Granth Sahib are written in poetic verse, and are intended to be sung.<br> Singing isn a crucial component of Sikhism; Guru Nanak himself was known to sing his teachings<br> as he travelled across South Asia on foot. The hymns of the Gurus are known as Gurbani, the Guru’s<br>
             word.<br>Guru Nanak formalised three core pillars of Sikhism, and they are:<ul>
            <li>Vaṇḍ Chakkō: Sharing with others, helping those in need, as well as participating as part of<br> a community. A spirit of giving, sharing, and caring for one another is central to Sikhism.</li>
            <li>Kirat Karō: Earning/making a living honestly, without exploitation or fraud, and speaking the<br> truth at all times.</li>
            <li>Naam Japna: Meditating on God's name to live a life of decency and humility. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Sikhs see the temporary distractions of the material world as an illusion, or Māyā. The five qualities<br> of ego, anger, greed, attachment and lust are known as the Five Thieves that rob a person of their<br> ability to realize their oneness with God and creation. Sikhs work to counteract the temptations<br> of these qualities through the Sikh values of service, equality, and seeking justice for all.<br>Sikhs believe that one’s form on Earth is only a temporary vessel for the eternal soul. Thus, the death<br> of the physical body is a natural part of the life cycle, while the soul remains. Sikhs believe in reincarnation,<br> meaning death is not an end, but merely the progression of the soul on its journey toward God. </p>

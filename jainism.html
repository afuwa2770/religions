        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><figure><img src="img/jain.jpg" alt="jain"><figcaption>Jainism Symbol</figcaption></figure>The name Jainism derives from the Sanskrit verb ji, “to conquer.” It refers to the ascetic battle<br> that, it is believed, Jain renunciants (monks and nuns) must fight against the passions and<br> bodily senses to gain enlightenment, or omniscience and purity of soul. The most illustrious<br> of those few individuals who have achieved enlightenment are called Jina (literally, “Conqueror”),<br> and the tradition's monastic and lay adherents are called Jain (“Follower of the Conquerors”), or<br> Jaina. This term came to replace a more ancient designation, Nirgrantha (“Bondless”), originally<br> applied to renunciants only.<br>Jainism has been confined largely to India, although the recent migration of Indians to other,<br> predominantly English-speaking countries has spread its practice to many Commonwealth nations<br> and to the United States. Precise statistics are not available, but it is estimated that there are more<br> than six million Jains, the vast majority of whom live in India.<br>Along with Hinduism and Buddhism, Jainism is one of the three most ancient Indian religious<br> traditions still in existence and an integral part of South Asian religious belief and practice. While<br> often employing concepts shared with Hinduism and Buddhism, the result of a common cultural<br> and linguistic background, the Jain tradition must be regarded as an independent phenomenon<br> rather than as a Hindu sect or a Buddhist heresy, as some earlier Western scholars believed.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Early 7th century B.C.E-C. 5th Century C.E, scholars  of religion generally hold that<br> Jainism originated in the 7th-5th century BCE in the Ganges basin of eastern India,<br> the scene of intense religious speculation and activity at that time. Buddhism also<br> appeared in this region, as did other belief systems that renounced the world and<br> opposed the ritualistic Brahmanic schools whose prestige derived from their claim<br> of purity and their ability to perform the traditional rituals and sacrifices and to<br> interpret their meaning. These new religious perspectives promoted asceticism,<br> the abandonment of ritual, domestic and social action, and the attainment of<br> spiritual illumination in an attempt to win, through one's own efforts, freedom<br> from repeated rebirth (samsara).</p>
        <p>Jains believe that their tradition does not have a historical founder. The first Jain figure<br> for whom there is reasonable historical evidence is Parshvanatha (or Parshva), a<br> renunciant teacher who may have lived in the 7th century BCE and founded a<br> community based upon the abandonment of worldly concerns. Jain tradition regards him<br> as the 23rd Tirthankara (literally, “Ford Maker”; i.e., one who leads the way across  the<br> stream of rebirths to salvation) of the current age (kalpa). The 24th and last Tirthankara<br> of that age was Vardhamana, who is known by the epithet Mahavira (“Great Hero”) and<br> is believed to have been the last teacher of “right” knowledge, faith, and practice.<br> Although traditionally dated to 599-527 BCE, Mahavira must be regarded as a close<br> contemporary of the Buddha (traditionally believed to have lived in 563-483 BCE but<br> who probably flourished about a century later). The legendary accounts of Mahavira's life<br> preserved by the Jain scriptures provide the basis for his biography and enable some<br> conclusions to be formulated about the nature of the early community he founded.</p>
        <p>Mahavira, like the Buddha, was the son of a chieftain of the Kshatriya (warrior) class. At<br> age 30 he renounced his princely status to take up the ascetic life. Although he was<br> accompanied for a time by the eventual founder of the Ajivika sect, Goshala Maskariputra,<br> Mahavira spent the next 121/2 years following a path of solitary and intense asceticism. He<br> then converted 11 disciples (called ganadharas), all of whom were originally Brahmans. Two<br> of these disciples, Indrabhuti Gautama and Sudharman, both of whom survived Mahavira,<br> are regarded as the founders of the historical Jain monastic community, and a third, Jambu, is<br> believed to be the last person of the current age to gain enlightenment. Mahavira is believed<br> to have died at Pavapuri, near modern Patna.</p>
        <p>The community appears to have grown quickly. According to Jain tradition, it numbered<br> 14,000 monks and 36,000 nuns at the time of Mahavira's death. From the beginning the<br> community was subject to schisms over technicalities of doctrine; however, these were<br> easily resolved. The only schism to have a lasting effect concerned a dispute over proper<br> monastic practice, with the Shvetambara (“White-Robed”) sect arguing that monks and nuns<br> should wear white robes and the Digambara (“Sky-Clad”; i.e., naked) sect claiming that a true<br> monk (but not a nun) should be naked. This controversy gave rise to a further dispute as to<br> whether or not a soul can attain liberation (moksha) from a female body (a possibility the<br> Digambaras deny).</p>
        <p>This sectarian division, still existent today, probably took time to assume formal shape.<br> Its exact origins remain unclear, in part because the stories describing the origins of the<br> schism were designed to justify each sect's authority and denigrate the other. These accounts<br> were written centuries after the fact and are valueless as genuine historical testimony. The<br> consolidation of the Shvetambara-Digambara division was probably the result of a series of<br> councils held to codify and preserve the Jain scriptures, which had existed as oral  tradition<br> long after Mahavira's death. Of the councils recorded in Jain history, the last one, held at<br> Valabhi in Saurashtra (in modern Gujarat) in either 453 or 456 CE, without Digambara<br> participation, codified the Shvetambara canon that is still in use. The Digambara monastic<br> community denounced the codification, and the schism between the two communities<br> became irrevocable.</p>
        <h3>Ritual Practices and Religious Institutions</h3>
        <p>Monks, nuns and their practices;Shvetambara monks are allowed to retain a few possessions<br> such as a robe, an alms bowl, a whisk broom, and a mukhavastrika (a piece of cloth held<br> over the mouth to protect against the ingestion of small insects), which are presented by<br> a senior monk at the time of initiation. For the non-image-worshipping Sthanakavasis and<br> the Terapanthis, the mukhavastrika must be worn at all times. After initiation a monk must<br> adhere to the “great vows” (mahavratas) to avoid injuring any life-form, lying, stealing,<br> having sexual intercourse, or accepting personal possessions. To help him keep his vows,<br> a monk's life is carefully regulated in all details by specific ordinances and by the oversight<br> of his superiors. For example, to help him observe the vow of nonviolence, a monk may not<br> take his simple, vegetarian meals after dark, because to do so would increase the possibility<br> of harming insects that might be attracted to the food. In addition, drinking water must<br> first be boiled to ensure that there are no life-forms in it. Monks are expected to suffer with<br> equanimity hardships imposed by the weather, geographic terrain, travel, or physical abuse.<br> However, exceptions are allowed in emergencies, since a monk who survives a calamity can<br> purify himself by confession and by practicing even more rigorous austerities.</p>
        <p>Digambara monks take the same “great vows” as do the Shvetambara, but, in acknowledgment<br> of a much more intense interpretation of the vow of nonpossession, full-fledged Digambara<br> monks remain naked, while lower-grade Digambara monks wear a loincloth and keep with<br> them  one piece of cloth not more than 1.5 yards (1.4 metres) long. Digambara monks use a<br> peacock-feather duster to sweep the ground where they walk to avoid injuring any life-forms<br> and drink water from a gourd. They beg for their only meal of the day using the cupped palms<br> of their hand as an alms bowl. They regard their interpretation of the Jain monastic vocation<br> as more in accord with the ancient model than that followed by the Shvetambaras.</p>
        <p>All Jain renunciants must exercise the three guptis (care in thought, speech, and action) and<br> the five samitis (types of vigilance over conduct). Essential to regular monastic ritual are the<br> six “obligatory actions” (avashyaka), practiced daily and at important times of the ritual calendar:<br> equanimity (samayika, a form of contemplative activity, which, in theory operates throughout<br> the monk's entire career); praise of the Tirthankaras; obeisance to the Tirthankaras, teachers,<br> and scriptures; confession; resolution to avoid sinful activities; and “abandonment of the body”<br> (standing or sitting in a meditative posture).</p>
        <p>The type of austerities in which a monk engages, the length of time he practices them, and their<br> severity are carefully regulated by his preceptor, who takes into account the monk's spiritual<br> development, his capacity to withstand the austerities, and his ability to understand how they<br> help further his spiritual progress. The theoretical culmination of a monk's ascetic rigours is<br> the act of sallekhana, in which he lies on one side on a bed of thorny grass and ceases  to<br> move or eat. This act of ritual starvation is the monk's ultimate act of nonattendance,  by which<br> he lets go of the body for the sake of his soul. Jain ideology views this as the ultimate act of<br> self-control and triumph over the passions, rather than simply as suicide. While widely followed<br> in ancient and medieval times, sallekhana is much less common today.</p>
        <p>Both the Shvetambaras and Digambaras allow the initiation of nuns, and among the Shvetambaras<br> nuns outnumber monks by a ratio of approximately 3 to 1. Nevertheless, the status of Jain nuns<br> is less prestigious than that of monks, to whom they are obliged by convention and textual stipulation<br> to defer, despite the fact that these nuns are often women of great learning and spiritual attainment.<br> In Digambara Jainism, nuns, who wear robes, accept the necessity of being reborn as men before<br> they can advance significantly on the ascetic path.</p>

        <h1>Shinto Faith</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Shinto has many faces, for some it is reservior of local community traditions and a away of<br> ritually marking milestones throught the year and in one's life. To others it is an institution<br> that attests to the Japaneese emperor's divine status as a descendant of the sun godess Amaterasu<br> or a life affirming nature relgion.</p>
        <p>Shinto (literally “the way of the gods”) is Japan's native belief system and predates historical<br> records. The many practices, attitudes, and institutions that have developed to make up Shinto<br> revolve around the Japanese land and seasons and their relation with the human inhabitants.<br> Expressions of Shinto beliefs toward nature include the recognition of a divine spirit (kami) in<br> venerable old trees, large mountains, and tall waterfalls, as well as celebrations of the highlights<br> of each season. (This reverence is often expressed by the placement of a small shrine next to the<br> natural element being celebrated or garlanding it with a white rope.) Traditionally, Shinto also<br> involves purification rites and customs to overcome the polluting effects of death and decay.<br> However, Shinto does not espouse a moral code, lacks religious scriptures, and does not conceive<br> of a life after death.<br>The introduction of Buddhism to Japan did not cause the abandonment of Shinto. Instead, the<br> pantheons  of both religions were expanded so that Buddhist figures adopted complementary<br> Shinto identities and Shinto kami were thought to strive toward Buddhist enlightenment. In this<br> way, new converts to Buddhism were not obliged to abandon their traditional beliefs, and<br> Buddhism was able to appeal to a wide range of people</p>
        <p>The earliest sacred items associated with Shinto practices are the mirrors, swords, and jewels<br> found in ancient burial sites. It was not until the arrival and influence of Buddhism, with its long<br> tradition of producing anthropomorphic representations of Buddhist deities, that statues<br> and paintings of Shinto divinities started to be produced, around the eighth century. Without<br> scriptural descriptions of the appearance of kami, early craftsmen of Shinto images depicted them<br> as men and women in secular, courtly costumes and attitudes. Traditionally, these icons  were<br> hidden from the view of  practitioners, kept in closed inner sanctuaries of shrines, and venerated<br> from the outside</p>
        <h3>Beliefs</h3>
        <p>But at its core, Shinto is about the ritual veneration of kami.These myriad deities can take different<br> forms. Many are associated with features of the natural world, like lightning and the sun, while others<br> look after human concerns, from marital relationships to acing one's college exams.One of Shinto's<br> primary concerns is the management of spiritual impurities through ritual purification. According to<br> Shinto thought, impurities accumulate simply as a product of living in this world, as well as through<br> contact with sources of impurity, such as death or disease, and committing inappropriate acts.<br> Because spiritual impurities offend the kami and are capable of threatening social order and people's<br> well-being, Shinto priests must purify them regularly through ritual.</p>
        <p>Besides purification, Shinto also provides what contemporary Japanese religion experts Ian Reader<br> and George Tanabe Jr. call “practical benefits.” These innumerable benefits include good health,<br> prosperity and safety. At Shinto shrines and in other sacred spaces, both priests and regular folks<br> from all walks of life perform rituals to express gratitude for the deities' protection and pray for<br> their continued blessings.</p>
        <h3>Ceremonies and Early Clan Religion</h3>
        <p>In ancient times small states were gradually formed at various places. By the middle of the 4th<br> century CE, a nation with an ancestor of the present Imperial Household as its head had probably<br> been established. The constituent unit of society at that time was the uji (clan or family), and the<br> head of each uji was in charge of worshiping the clan's ujigami—its particular tutelary or guardian<br> deity. The prayer for good harvest in spring and the harvest ceremony in autumn were two major<br> festivals honouring the ujigami. Divination, water purification, and lustration (ceremonial purification),<br> which are all mentioned in the Japanese classics, became popular, and people started to build shrines<br> for their kami.<br>Ancient Shintō was polytheistic. People found kami in nature, which ruled seas or mountains, as well<br> as in outstanding men. They also believed in kami of ideas such as growth, creation, and judgment.<br> Though each clan made the tutelary kami the core of its unity, such kami were not necessarily the ancestral<br> deities of the clan. Sometimes kami of nature and kami of ideas were regarded as their tutelary kami. </p>
        <p>Two different views of the world were present in ancient Shintō. One was the three-dimensional view<br> in which the Plain of High Heaven (Takama no Hara, the kami's world), Middle Land (Nakatsukuni,<br> the present world), and the Hades (Yomi no Kuni, the world after death) were arranged in vertical order.<br> The other view was a two-dimensional one in which this world and the Perpetual Country (Tokoyo,<br> a utopian place far beyond the sea) existed in horizontal order. Though the three-dimensional view of<br> the world (which is also characteristic of North Siberian and Mongolian shamanistic culture) became<br> the representative view observed in Japanese myths, the two-dimensional view of the world (which is<br> also present in Southeast Asian culture) was dominant among the populace</p>

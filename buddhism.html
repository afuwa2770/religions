        <h1>Buddhism Faith</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Buddhism was founded by <strong>Siddhartha Gautama</strong>who later became <strong>Buddha.</strong>He lived during the 15th<br> century BC. He was born in a wealthy family as a prince in a country currently known as Nepal. Not<br> only having a good and easy life, Gautama was moved by suffering in the world. Gautama gave up his<br> lavish life and endured poverty. He promoted the idea of "Middle Way"( extreme asceticism or extreme<br> wealth) were the path to enlightment, but rather a way of life between the two xetremes. After six years<br> of searching, Buddhists believe Gautama found enlightenment while meditating under a Bodhi tree(the<br> tree of awakening). He spent the rest of his life teaching others about how to achieve this spiritual state.<br>When Gautama passed away around 483 B.C., his followers began to organize a religious movement.<br> Buddhaâ€™s teachings became the foundation for what would develop into Buddhism.In the 3rd century<br> B.C., Ashoka the Great, the Mauryan Indian emperor, made Buddhism the state religion of India.<br> Buddhist monasteries were built, and missionary work was encouraged. The Mahabodhi temple in Bihar<br> India- the site of enlightment, is now the major Buddhist pilgrimage site. </p>
        <h3>Buddhism Beliefs</h3>
        <p>The Budha taught about four norbel truths. The first trueth is called "suffering(dukkha)" which teaches<br> that everyone in life is suffering in some way. The second truth is "origin of suffering(Samudaya)", this<br> means that all sufferings come from desire(Tanha). The third trueth is "cessation of suffering(Noridha)".<br> and it is said that it is possible to stop suffering and achieve enlightment. The fourth truth is " path to the<br> cessation of suffering(Magga)", is about the "Middle Way" which are the steps to achieve enlightment.</p>
        <p>Budhists believe in the wheel of rebirth,where souls are born again in two different bodies depending on<br> the way they conducted themselves in their previous lives. This is connected to "Karma", which refers to<br> a person's good or bad actions in their past life, can impact them in the future.</p>
        <p>There are two main groups of Buddhism,"Mahayana Buddhism" and "Theravada Buddhism". Mahayana<br> Buddhism is common in  Tibet, China, Taiwan, Japan and Mongolia. It emphasizes the role models of<br> bodhisattvas( beings that have achieved enlightment and return to teach humans). Theravada Buddhism<br> is common in Sri Lanka, Combodia, Thailand, Laos and Burma(Myanmar). It emphasizes a monastic lifestyle<br> and meditation,as the way to enlightment.</p>
        <p>Buddhism has been a contrversial religion. The head of the Tibetan school of Buddhism and trditional leader<br> of Tibet, the Dlai Lama, fled from China-controlled Tibet in 1959 to India in fear of his life. Many Tibetan<br> Buddhists actively resist Chinese control of the region. Recently, the current Dalia Lama, who is understood<br> to be the fourteenth reincarnation of the first Dlai Lama, has raised questions over whether and where he will<br> choose to reincarnate.</p>

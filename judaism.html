        <h1>Judaism History</h1>
        <p><figure><img src="img/jewish.png" alt="jewish">
        <figcaption>Jewish Religious Symbol</figcaption></figure>Judaism is the world's oldest monotheistic religion, dating back nearly 4,000 years.<br> Followers of Judaism believe in one God who revealed himself through ancient prophets.<br> The history of Judaism is essential to understanding the Jewish faith, which has a rich<br> heritage of law, culture and tradition.<br>The origins of Jewish faith are explained throughout the Torah. According to the text,<br> God first revealed himself to a Hebrew man named Abraham, who became known as<br> the  founder of Judaism.Jews believe that God made a special covenant with Abraham<br> and that he and his descendants were chosen people who would create a great nation.<br>Abraham's son Isaac, and his grandson Jacob, also became central figures in ancient<br> Jewish history. Jacob took the name Israel, and his children and future generations<br> became known as Israelites.<br>More than 1,000 years after Abraham, the prophet Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt after<br> being enslaved for hundreds of years.According to scriptures, God revealed his laws, known<br> as the Ten Commandments, to Moses at Mt. Sinai.<br>Around 1000 B.C., King David ruled the Jewish people. His son Solomon built the first holy<br> Temple in Jerusalem, which became the central place of worship for Jews.The kingdom fell<br> apart around 931 B.C., and the Jewish people split into two groups: Israel in the North and<br> Judah in the South.Sometime around 587 B.C., the Babylonians destroyed the first Temple<br> and sent many Jews into exile.A second Temple was built in about 516 B.C, but was eventually<br> destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.The destruction of the second Temple was significant<br> because Jewish people no longer had a primary place to gather, so they shifted their focus<br> to worshipping in local synagogues.</p>
         <h2>Beliefs and Holy Books</h2>
         <p>Jewish people believe there's only one God who has established a covenant or<br> special agreement with them. Their God communicates to believers through<br> prophets and rewards good deeds while also punishing evil.Most Jews (with<br> the exception of a few groups) believe that their Messiah hasn't yet come, but<br> will one  day.Jewish people worship in holy places known as synagogues, and<br> their spiritual leaders are called rabbis. The six-pointed Star of David is the<br> symbol of Judaism.Today, there are about 14 million Jews worldwide. Most of<br> them live in the United States and Israel. Traditionally, a person is considered<br> Jewish if his or her mother is Jewish.<br>While the Tanakh (which includes the Torah) is considered the sacred text of<br> Judaism, many other important manuscripts were composed in later years.<br> These offered insights into how the Tanakh should be interpreted and<br> documented oral laws that were previously not written down.Around 200 A.D,<br> scholars compiled the Mishnahâ€”a text that describes and explains the Jewish<br> code of law that was previously orally communicated.</p>
         <p>Talmud-Later, the Talmud, a collection of teachings and commentaries on Jewish<br> law, was created. The Talmud contains the Mishnah and another text known  as the<br> Gemara (which examines the Mishnah). It includes the interpretations  of thousands<br> of rabbis and outlines the importance of 613 commandments of Jewish law.The first<br> version of the Talmud was finalized around the 3rd century A.D. The second form<br> was completed during the 5th century A.D.<br>Judaism embraces several other written texts and commentaries. One example is the<br> 13 Articles of Faith, which was written by a Jewish philosopher named Maimonides.<br>Shabbat-Shabbat is recognized as a day of rest and prayer for Jews. It typically begins<br> at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday.Observing Shabbat can take<br> many forms, depending on the type of Judaism that a Jewish family may follow.<br> Orthodox and Conservative Jews, for example, may refrain from performing any<br> physical labor, using any electrical device or other prohibited activities.Most observant<br> Jews celebrate Shabbat by reading or discussing the Torah, attending a synagogue or<br> socializing with other Jews at Shabbat meals.</p>

        <h1>Bahai Faith</h1>
        <p>The word Bahai is either used as an adjective to refer to the Baha'i Faithor for a follower of Baha'u'llah.<br> The word is not a noun, meaning the religion as a whole. It is derived from the Arabic word Baha, meaning<br> "glory" or "splendour". The use of the term "Bahaism"(or Baha'ism) has been used in the past, but is fading<br> from use. Bahai Faith is a monotheistic religion that was founded by Baha'u'llah in Persia during the 19th century,<br> emphasizing unity with the spirit of  all humankind. It is estimated that there are five to six million Baha'is around<br> the world in more than 200 countries.</p>
        <p>Baha'i teachings emphasize unity of the major world religions. Religious history has been see to have unfolded<br> through a series of devine  messengers, each establishing a religion suited to the needs of the time and<br> also the capacity of the people. These messengers include Abraham, Krishna, Budha, Jesus, Muhammad and others,<br> including the most recently Baha'u'llah in Bahai belief. Each messenger taught of the next, and  Baha'u'llah's<br> life and teachings fulfill end-time promises of all previous scriptures. Humanity is understood to be involved in collective<br> evolution, and the need of the present time, is for the establishment of peace, justice and unity on a global scale.</p>
        <h2>Beliefs</h2>
        <p>Three core principles establish Bahai teachings and doctrine:<ul>
            <li>The unity of God</li>
            <li>Religion</li>
            <li>Of humankind</li>
        </ul>from these stems, comes the belief tha God reveals his wills through devine educators, with the purpose of transforming<br> the character of humankind and developing,within those who respond,moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen<br> as unified and progresive age to age.</p>
        <p>Bahai writings describe a single inaccessible omniscient, omnipresent, and almighty God who created all things<br> in the universe. The existance of God and the universe is eternal , without beginning or end. Though inaccessible<br> directily, God is seen as conscious of creation, with a purpose that is expressed throuh messengers termed<br> manifestations of God.</p>
        <p>Bahai teachings state that God is too great for humans to comprehend, or to create an accurate image of human<br> understanding of God is through the revelations and manifestations. In Bahai religion, there is a significant emphasis<br> on mmontheism.Their teachings state that the attributes applied to God are used to translate Godlines into<br> human terms and to help individuals concentrate on personal attributes in worshiping God, in order to develop potentialities<br> on their spiritual path. According to the teachings, human purpose is to learn,know and love God through prayer and reflection.   </p>

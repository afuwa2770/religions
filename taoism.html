        <h1>Taoism Faith</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>,
        <p>Taoism has no founder and no founding date. It grew out of various religious and philosophical traditions<br> in ancient China, including shamanism and nature religion.<br>Livia Kohn states that:
        <pre>
            Taoism as a religion began in the year 142 C.E
            with the revelation of the Taoto Zhang Daoling
            or Chang Tao-ling by the personified god of the
            Tao, Taishang Laojun <strong>(Lao Tzu)</strong>, the highest venerable
            Lord.
        </pre></p>
        <p>Zhang Daoling became the first Celestial Master and founder of the first organized Taoist school of thought.<br> This tradition continues to the present day, with the current Celestial Master living in Taiwan.<br>Early religious Taoism was rooted in the ideas of the Taoist thinkers, to which were added local religious rituals<br> and beliefs, both to provide examples of Taoist philosophy, and integrate Taoism into the existing world views<br> of all levels of the Chinese people.Taoism was first recognised as a religious system during the 4th and 3rd<br> centuries B.C.E. The publication of the Tao Te Ching and other works provided a focus for Taoist thinking.<br> Taoism became a semi-official Chinese religion during the Tang dynasty and continued during the Song<br> dynasty. As Confucianism gained popularity Taoism gradually fell from favour, and changed from an official<br> religion to a popular religious tradition.</p>
        <p>After the communist takeover of China, Taoism was banned and its followers re-educated, with the result that<br> the number of practicing Taoists fell by 99% in 10 years. At this time Taoism began to flourish in the greater<br> freedom on offer in Taiwan. After the end of the Cultural Revolution the Chinese government began to allow<br> a small measure of religious freedom. Taoism began to revive in China, and Taoist temples and practitioners<br> can now be found throughout the country. </p>
        <h2>Taoism at Glance</h2>
        <p>Toaism is an ancient tradition of phyilosophy and religious belief that is deeply rooted in Chinese customs<br> and worldview.<br>Toaism is also refered to as Daoism, which is the more accurate way of representing in english the sound<br> of  the Chinese word.<br>Toaism is about the Tao, translated as the way. However, its hard to say exactly what it means. The Tao is<br> the ultimate creative principle of the universe. All things are unified and connected in Tao.</p>
        <h4>Origin</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Toaism originated in China 2000 years ago.</li>
            <li>It's a religion of unity and opposites;<strong>Yin Yang</strong>. The principle of Yin Yang sees the world as filled<br> with complementary force-action and non-action, light and dark, hot and cold  etc.</li>
            <li>The Tao is not<strong> God</strong>and it's not worshiped. It includes many deities, that are worshiped in Taoist<br> temples. They are part of the universe and depend, like everything, on the Tao.</li>
        </ul> 
        <h4>What Taoism Promotes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieving harmony, or union with nature.</li>
            <li>The persuit of spiritual immorality.</li>
            <li>Being "virtuous"(but not ostentatiously so ).</li>
            <li>Self-development.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Practices Include:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Meditation</li>
            <li>Feng shui</li>
            <li>Fortune telling</li>
            <li>Reading and chanting of scriptures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before the communist revolution 50 years ago, Taoism was one of the strongest religions in China. After the<br> compaign to destroy no-communist religion,the numbers significantly reduced, and it has become difficult to<br> assess the statistical popularity of Taoism in the world. </p>

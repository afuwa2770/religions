    <h1> Christianity and Beliefs</h1>
    <h2>The Beginning of Christianity</h2>
    <P>Christianity traces its begginning to the miraculous, adult ministry, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br> Over 2000 years ago in Palestine today known as Israel. Jesus was born into a humble jewish family and<br> his mother was a young peasant woman named Mary.</P>
    <p>Christians believe that Jesus's father was the holy spirit of God which made him both fully human and fully<br> divine. Jesus's earliest followers came to believe that he was the Messiah sent by God to free God's people<br> from slavery, sin, and death.<br> Christians believe that God sent his son Jesus in human form, so that people would better understand that<br> God is a caring and loving parent. </p>
    <p>Jesus lived and experienced the suffering of humans. He heald the sick and told stories, or parables and preached<br> sermons that taught what God wanted people to do, to love God with all their hearts and love their neighbours as<br> they love themselves. Jesus taught by example, by being loving and forgiving himself, he taught others by loving<br> and forgiving especially towards those who were considered outcasts in society.</p>
    <p>During his adult ministry, Jesus built up a loyal following led by his twelve diciples. He also made enemies among<br> the political and religious leaders during his time. But in the end, these powerful leaders were threatened due the<br> growing following of Jesus that the Roman governer eneded up sentencing him to death and had him cricified.<br>On the third day after Jesus's death, his followers found his tomb empty and discovered that he has been raised from<br> the dead. Christians believe that the painful sacrifice of Jesus's life on the cross shows how much God loves His people.<br> Jesus paid with his life on earth  ofr the sins of the world. </p>
    <p>Christians beleive that God showed Jesus's message of love and forgiving  was more powerful than death after raising<br> him from the dead, and that believeing in Jesus and following the example of his life and his teachings would lead to<br> eternal life after death. His ressurection is the sign of God's salvation offered to all people.</p>
    <p>After his ressurection, Jesus Christ's followers spread his message throught the world, creating Christian Church. And<br> today there are about two billion Christian christians living all over the world, with the belief that Jesus is the son of<br> God(fully human and divine) and he died on the cross for the sins of the world.</p>
